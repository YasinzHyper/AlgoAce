# AlgoAce

> **Your AI-powered interview prep coach** — personalised DSA roadmaps, curated LeetCode problem sets, timed challenges, voice-based mock interviews, and a feedback loop that actually learns from how you're doing.

AlgoAce takes a user's goal (*"Google L4 in 8 weeks"*), current knowledge, and available time, then generates a week-by-week study roadmap, populates each week with company-tagged LeetCode problems, tracks every solve, and continuously coaches the user with Gemini-powered feedback that knows their pace, weak topics, and recent mock-interview scores.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📍 Personalised Roadmaps
- Tell AlgoAce your **goal, target company, deadline, weekly hours, and current knowledge** — it generates a multi-week plan of DSA topics (with difficulty ramps) plus supporting CS fundamentals.
- Each week is auto-populated with **curated LeetCode problems** filtered by topic, difficulty, and company tag from a built-in dataset of 1800+ problems.
- Roadmaps are rendered as an interactive **React-Flow graph** and an editable week-by-week board.

### 📈 Progress Tracking & Analytics
- Every problem/topic completion is timestamped and rolled up into:
  - **Activity heatmap** (GitHub-style contribution calendar)
  - **Streak tracking** (current + longest, computed via a Postgres function)
  - **Topic mastery** — which tags you're strong/weak at, derived from the LeetCode tag join
  - **Pace vs plan** — are you ahead, on track, or behind your deadline?
- A unified **Dashboard** surfaces headline stats, the closest deadline, last interview score, and challenge points at a glance.

### 🤖 AI Feedback Loop
- **Per-week coaching** — after marking problems complete, generate goal-aware feedback referencing the *named* problems you solved/skipped that week.
- **Roadmap-level "AI Coach"** — a cached, regeneratable summary covering what's working, what's at risk, and structured `focus_areas` (topic → reason → action). Folds in your latest mock-interview score so coaching stays coherent across surfaces.
- All feedback uses Gemini with `response_mime_type="application/json"` for deterministic, parseable output.

### ⚡ Timed Challenges
- Generate a **timed problem-set session** from your weak topics (or pick your own topics/difficulty/duration).
- Live countdown, mark-as-solved, auto-finalise on expiry, difficulty-weighted scoring with a time bonus.
- Full session history + a **points leaderboard** (week / month / all-time) backed by a Postgres `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC.

### 🎙️ AI Mock Interviewer (voice)
- Real-time **voice-to-voice** technical, behavioural, or system-design interviews powered by **Gemini Live**.
- The interviewer is **context-aware**: it knows your goal, target company, pace, strong/weak topics, and won't re-ask problems you recently solved.
- Browser never sees the API key — the backend mints **single-use ephemeral tokens** with the system prompt, voice, and tools locked server-side.
- After the call, the transcript is graded against a per-type **rubric** (problem-solving / coding / communication / complexity / hints) and a 0–100 score + structured feedback report is saved and charted in Analytics.

### 🧩 Problem Explanations & Help
- On-demand AI explanations for any problem in the dataset (approach, walkthrough, complexity).
- Global search across problems, roadmaps, and FAQs.

```

- **Auth** — Supabase Auth on both sides. The client attaches the session JWT as a `Bearer` token; every FastAPI router validates it via `supabase.auth.get_user()`.
- **Data** — All user state (roadmaps, tasks, progress, completions, streaks, challenges, interview sessions, feedback) lives in Supabase Postgres. See [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md).
- **AI** — Gemini for roadmap generation, problem recommendation, explanations, feedback, and rubric grading; Gemini **Live** for the real-time voice interviewer. CrewAI tooling is wired for a future multi-agent orchestration layer.
- **Dataset** — `api/dataset/leetcode-problems.csv` (id, title, description, difficulty, tags, companies, acceptance rate…) is loaded into pandas at startup and used for problem selection, hydration, and topic-mastery joins.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+** (3.12 works)
- **Node.js 18+** (20 LTS recommended)
- A **Supabase** project (URL + anon key + service key)
- A **Google Gemini API key**

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd api
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # or create .env manually — see api/README.md for vars
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
API runs on `http://localhost:8000` (Swagger at `/docs`). Full instructions: [`api/README.md`](api/README.md).

### 2. Database

Apply the migrations in [`api/schema.md`](api/schema.md) to your Supabase project (via the SQL editor or CLI). They are idempotent and ordered. See [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md) for a table-by-table explanation.

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
# create client/.env.local — see client/README.md
npm run dev
```
App runs on `http://localhost:3000`. Full instructions: [`client/README.md`](client/README.md).

> The client currently talks to the API at a hard-coded `http://localhost:8000`. Run both locally on the default ports.

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Future Plans

- **Multi-agent orchestration** — promote the CrewAI scaffolding into a true crew (roadmap agent · recommender agent · feedback agent · explainer agent) with shared memory.
- **Mock-interview text fallback** — degrade to text chat in the same UI when the mic is denied.
- **Per-user interview quota & cost guards** — cap monthly Live minutes server-side.
- **Server WS relay** — fallback transport if Gemini ephemeral tokens move out of `v1alpha`.
- **Social & gamification** — friend lists, team challenges, badges, daily shared challenge with its own leaderboard tab, head-to-head mode.
- **Leaderboard weighting** — optionally fold interview scores into the points formula.
- **Repo-wide lint cleanup** — clear long-standing `no-explicit-any` / `no-unescaped-entities` errors so `next build` passes cleanly.

See [`plans/`](plans/) for detailed implementation specs of in-flight features.
